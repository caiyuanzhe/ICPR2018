In this paper, we introduce a feasible speaker recognition system with short text classification technique for co-channel situation. This system takes mix speaker audio as input, the audio file is transcribed into text file with time stamp by ASR. Applying short text classification method, homogenous speech segments can be effectively identified so the audio file is segmented into homogenous audio segments, which can be concatenated into a target speaker, say customer. We show the proposed system can work on co-channel audios and the performance is closed to the clean single track target audios with no more than 15\% relative equal error rate. We also show that improvement by replacing GMM-UBM with HLSTM-UBM, which achieves about 14.3\% improvement in the real-world financial phone call data set.
